# Be extra careful when adjusting this configuration as there is possibility to
# create infinite agent-collector-agent loop that will quickly overflow collector.
# This is especially true when adjusting timing parameters. For example setting
# sql.trace.time to 0 will create such condition for sure.

# Add another JDBC profile (H2, PGSQL) if necessary.
